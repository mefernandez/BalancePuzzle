About the kata by @eloy_iv

In this kata you'll find a Java implementation. Although I'm not an expert in TDD,
I tried my best to remain as YAGNI as I could.

The code is pretty straightforward. It's divided into Java code and JUnit test.
I developed it using standard Eclipse.

You'll see I organized some packages following the evolution of tests and code refactoring.
It would seem a little awkward to do this homemade versioning and hosting the whole thing
at github.com, but I find it more easy to navigate through folders to quickly see what's changing
from one version to another rather than using Git itself. Maybe I'm wrong.

So here's what's into each version.

.v1
Basic tests for 1, 2 and 3 marbles. Very helpful to clear out some things from my mind,
like deciding classnames and basic API. Well, that's what TDD is for, isn't it?

.v2
